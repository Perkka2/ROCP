* Extracting the CP *
*********************

First, you must extract the contents of the .rar file into your webhost folder, where users can access it through index.php.

For those extracting the CP to a webhost, ensure that edit_config.php has read/write access.

**************************************************
* Quick and Easy Installation for Advanced Users *
*        (Know Aegis/Athena/CP/SQL well)         *
**************************************************

Edit config.php using your basic editor, the most important ones being db_host, db_username, db_password, db_name (for athena), passphrase, and server_type (0 = Aegis, 1 = OmniAthena, 2 = eAthena).
Note for Athena Users: db_name IS NOT cp! It is the database where your server information is stored (ragnarok by default).

Create Database cp, ensure proper permissions to the cp, and ragnarok server databases. If you are using OmniAthena, and wish to use logs, give it access to log database.

For Aegis Users, install the stored procedures and functions from install_functions.txt
For Athena Users, install mob_db and item_db if you are not using the SQL item_db/mob_db.

Run the following query to make an admin account:

Aegis Users:
	INSERT INTO cp.dbo.privilege SELECT AID, 4 FROM nLogin.dbo.login WHERE ID = 'your account name';
	
Athena Users:
	INSERT INTO cp.privilege SELECT account_id, 4 FROM ragnarok.login WHERE userid = 'your account name';

Log into the control panel, and add admins/GMs using the GM Menu Option 'Privileges'.

****************************
* Setting Up the Databases *
****************************

Aegis Users:

Create a new database, called 'cp'.
Follow instructions in install_functions.sql
Run the queries in install/Aegis/install.sql
Create a new login 'cp', password, your choice, default database cp with system administration privileges, and give it access to the following databases:

	cp, character, itemLog, nLogin, script, user

Athena Users:

Open install\install.sql, copy the entire query, and execute it with your chosen SQL program. It should create a database named 'cp', and a login, with proper permissions.
If you are using the item_db and mob_db tables for your server, skip the next step.
However, if you are not, you are advised to install item_mob_db.sql so that item and mob conversions can be performed.

*********************************
* Configuring the Control Panel *
*********************************

Edit config.php to your liking.
Register yourself an admin account on your server, if you havn't already.
Log into the Control Panel with the admin account that you added previously.
You can add more admins in the Privileges section of the drop down menu.
